# DrumLights
Arduino project with
* one as master with control elements
* multiple wireless slaves with RGB led lights

## One Arduino code for multiple Arduino boards

### One master board
* Switch to configure as master board
* 3 pot meters for R/G/B mixing
* Radio to transmit selected color codes to the slaves
* Controls own RGB led strip

### Multiple slave boards
* Radio to receive selected color codes from the master
* Control of RGB led strip according to received color code and effect

## Wiring
Slave is identical to master for radio and led strip, but doesn't have the master switch and potentio meters.
